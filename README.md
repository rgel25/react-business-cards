## Welcome! üëã

This is a simple React app about card components.

## The challenge

The challenge here was to find a way to display cards with different content without hardcoding the card components.

## My solution

First I created the card components and even went further and broke it to smaller components. I then fixed the styling for a single card with dummy info. Once the template for one card is ready, I made a JSON like file that contains 8 persons in an array and passed it to the card component as props. However, I only hardcoded the card rendering for each element in the array.
